            <h1>The National Hero Of Pakistan</h1>
            <p><b> Jinnah served as leader of the All-India Muslim League </b>from 1913 till Pakistan’s independence on August 14, 1947 and Pakistan’s first Governor-General from August 15, 1947 till his death on September 11, 1948. Jinnah rose to prominence in the Indian National Congress initially expounding ideas of Hindu-Muslim unity and helping shape the 1916 Luck now Pact between the Muslim League and the Indian National Congress; he also became a key leader in the All India Home Rule League. He proposed a fourteen-point constitutional reform plan to safeguard the political rights of Muslims in a self-governing India.
                Jinnah later advocated the Two-Nation Theory embracing the goal of creating a separate Muslim state as per the Lahore Resolution.  As the Indian National Congress and Muslim League failed to reach a power sharing formula for united India, 
                it prompted both the parties and the British to agree to independence of Pakistan and India. </p>
